# Weather Skill

Get current weather conditions and forecasts.

## When to Use

<<<<<<< HEAD
Quick one-liner:
=======
✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "What's the weather?"
- "Will it rain today/tomorrow?"
- "Temperature in [city]"
- "Weather forecast for the week"
- Travel planning weather checks

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- Historical weather data → use weather archives/APIs
- Climate analysis or trends → use specialized data sources
- Hyper-local microclimate data → use local sensors
- Severe weather alerts → check official NWS sources
- Aviation/marine weather → use specialized services (METAR, etc.)

## Location

Always include a city, region, or airport code in weather queries.

- Today only: `?1` · Current only: `?0`
- PNG: `curl -s "wttr.in/Berlin.png" -o /tmp/weather.png`

## Open-Meteo (fallback, JSON)

Free, no key, good for programmatic use:

- `%c` — Weather condition emoji
- `%t` — Temperature
- `%f` — "Feels like"
- `%w` — Wind
- `%h` — Humidity
- `%p` — Precipitation
- `%l` — Location
