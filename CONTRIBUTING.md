## AI/Vibe-Coded PRs Welcome! 🤖

Built with Codex, Claude, or other AI tools? **Awesome - just mark it!**

Please include in your PR:
- [ ] Mark as AI-assisted in the PR title or description
- [ ] Note the degree of testing (untested / lightly tested / fully tested)
- [ ] Include prompts or session logs if possible (super helpful!)
- [ ] Confirm you understand what the code does

AI PRs are first-class citizens here. We just want transparency so reviewers know what to look for.

## Current Focus & Roadmap 🗺

We are currently prioritizing:
- **Stability**: Fixing edge cases in channel connections (WhatsApp/Telegram).
- **UX**: Improving the onboarding wizard and error messages.
- **Skills**: Expanding the library of bundled skills and improving the Skill Creation developer experience.
- **Performance**: Optimizing token usage and compaction logic.

## Maintainers

We're selectively expanding the maintainer team.
If you're an experienced contributor who wants to help shape OpenClaw's direction — whether through code, docs, or community — we'd like to hear from you.

Being a maintainer is a responsibility, not an honorary title. We expect active, consistent involvement — triaging issues, reviewing PRs, and helping move the project forward.

Still interested? Email contributing@openclaw.ai with:

- Links to your PRs on OpenClaw (if you don't have any, start there first)
- Links to open source projects you maintain or actively contribute to
- Your GitHub, Discord, and X/Twitter handles
- A brief intro: background, experience, and areas of interest
- Languages you speak and where you're based
- How much time you can realistically commit

We welcome people across all skill sets — engineering, documentation, community management, and more.
We review every human-only-written application carefully and add maintainers slowly and deliberately.
Please allow a few weeks for a response.

## Report a Vulnerability

We take security reports seriously. Report vulnerabilities directly to the repository where the issue lives:

- **Core CLI and gateway** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
- **macOS desktop app** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (apps/macos)
- **iOS app** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (apps/ios)
- **Android app** — [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (apps/android)
- **ClawHub** — [openclaw/clawhub](https://github.com/openclaw/clawhub)
- **Trust and threat model** — [openclaw/trust](https://github.com/openclaw/trust)

For issues that don't fit a specific repo, or if you're unsure, email **security@openclaw.ai** and we'll route it.

### Required in Reports

1. **Title**
2. **Severity Assessment**
3. **Impact**
4. **Affected Component**
5. **Technical Reproduction**
6. **Demonstrated Impact**
7. **Environment**
8. **Remediation Advice**

Reports without reproduction steps, demonstrated impact, and remediation advice will be deprioritized. Given the volume of AI-generated scanner findings, we must ensure we're receiving vetted reports from researchers who understand the issues.
