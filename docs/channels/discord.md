# Discord (Bot API)

<<<<<<< HEAD

Status: ready for DM and guild text channels via the official Discord bot gateway.

## Quick setup (beginner)
1) Create a Discord bot and copy the bot token.
2) In the Discord app settings, enable **Message Content Intent** (and **Server Members Intent** if you plan to use allowlists or name lookups).
3) Set the token for Moltbot:
   - Env: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...`
   - Or config: `channels.discord.token: "..."`.
   - If both are set, config takes precedence (env fallback is default-account only).
4) Invite the bot to your server with message permissions (create a private server if you just want DMs).
5) Start the gateway.
6) DM access is pairing by default; approve the pairing code on first contact.

Minimal config:

## Quick setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Discord bot and enable intents">
    Create an application in the Discord Developer Portal, add a bot, then enable:

    - **Message Content Intent**
    - **Server Members Intent** (recommended for name-to-ID lookups and allowlist matching)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure token">

>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))
```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Goals
- Talk to Moltbot via Discord DMs or guild channels.
- Direct chats collapse into the agent's main session (default `agent:main:main`); guild channels stay isolated as `agent:<agentId>:discord:channel:<channelId>` (display names use `discord:<guildSlug>#<channelSlug>`).
- Group DMs are ignored by default; enable via `channels.discord.dm.groupEnabled` and optionally restrict by `channels.discord.dm.groupChannels`.
- Keep routing deterministic: replies always go back to the channel they arrived on.

## How it works
1. Create a Discord application → Bot, enable the intents you need (DMs + guild messages + message content), and grab the bot token.
2. Invite the bot to your server with the permissions required to read/send messages where you want to use it.
3. Configure Moltbot with `channels.discord.token` (or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` as a fallback).
4. Run the gateway; it auto-starts the Discord channel when a token is available (config first, env fallback) and `channels.discord.enabled` is not `false`.
   - If you prefer env vars, set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (a config block is optional).
5. Direct chats: use `user:<id>` (or a `<@id>` mention) when delivering; all turns land in the shared `main` session. Bare numeric IDs are ambiguous and rejected.
6. Guild channels: use `channel:<channelId>` for delivery. Mentions are required by default and can be set per guild or per channel.
7. Direct chats: secure by default via `channels.discord.dm.policy` (default: `"pairing"`). Unknown senders get a pairing code (expires after 1 hour); approve via `moltbot pairing approve discord <code>`.
   - To keep old “open to anyone” behavior: set `channels.discord.dm.policy="open"` and `channels.discord.dm.allowFrom=["*"]`.
   - To hard-allowlist: set `channels.discord.dm.policy="allowlist"` and list senders in `channels.discord.dm.allowFrom`.
   - To ignore all DMs: set `channels.discord.dm.enabled=false` or `channels.discord.dm.policy="disabled"`.
8. Group DMs are ignored by default; enable via `channels.discord.dm.groupEnabled` and optionally restrict by `channels.discord.dm.groupChannels`.
9. Optional guild rules: set `channels.discord.guilds` keyed by guild id (preferred) or slug, with per-channel rules.
10. Optional native commands: `commands.native` defaults to `"auto"` (on for Discord/Telegram, off for Slack). Override with `channels.discord.commands.native: true|false|"auto"`; `false` clears previously registered commands. Text commands are controlled by `commands.text` and must be sent as standalone `/...` messages. Use `commands.useAccessGroups: false` to bypass access-group checks for commands.
    - Full command list + config: [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands)
11. Optional guild context history: set `channels.discord.historyLimit` (default 20, falls back to `messages.groupChat.historyLimit`) to include the last N guild messages as context when replying to a mention. Set `0` to disable.
12. Reactions: the agent can trigger reactions via the `discord` tool (gated by `channels.discord.actions.*`).
    - Reaction removal semantics: see [/tools/reactions](/tools/reactions).
    - The `discord` tool is only exposed when the current channel is Discord.
13. Native commands use isolated session keys (`agent:<agentId>:discord:slash:<userId>`) rather than the shared `main` session.

Note: Name → id resolution uses guild member search and requires Server Members Intent; if the bot can’t search members, use ids or `<@id>` mentions.
Note: Slugs are lowercase with spaces replaced by `-`. Channel names are slugged without the leading `#`.
Note: Guild context `[from:]` lines include `author.tag` + `id` to make ping-ready replies easy.

## Config writes
By default, Discord is allowed to write config updates triggered by `/config set|unset` (requires `commands.config: true`).

Disable with:
```json5
{
  channels: { discord: { configWrites: false } }
}
=======
    Env fallback for the default account:

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...
>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))
```

  </Step>

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the “Discord Developer Portal” setup for running Moltbot in a server (guild) channel like `#help`.

### 1) Create the Discord app + bot user
1. Discord Developer Portal → **Applications** → **New Application**
2. In your app:
   - **Bot** → **Add Bot**
   - Copy the **Bot Token** (this is what you put in `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`)

### 2) Enable the gateway intents Moltbot needs
Discord blocks “privileged intents” unless you explicitly enable them.

In **Bot** → **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
- **Message Content Intent** (required to read message text in most guilds; without it you’ll see “Used disallowed intents” or the bot will connect but not react to messages)
- **Server Members Intent** (recommended; required for some member/user lookups and allowlist matching in guilds)

You usually do **not** need **Presence Intent**.

### 3) Generate an invite URL (OAuth2 URL Generator)
In your app: **OAuth2** → **URL Generator**

**Scopes**
- ✅ `bot`
- ✅ `applications.commands` (required for native commands)

**Bot Permissions** (minimal baseline)
- ✅ View Channels
- ✅ Send Messages
- ✅ Read Message History
- ✅ Embed Links
- ✅ Attach Files
- ✅ Add Reactions (optional but recommended)
- ✅ Use External Emojis / Stickers (optional; only if you want them)
=======
  <Step title="Invite the bot and start gateway">
    Invite the bot to your server with message permissions.

```bash
openclaw gateway
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve first DM pairing">

```bash
openclaw pairing list discord
openclaw pairing approve discord <CODE>
```

    Pairing codes expire after 1 hour.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Token resolution is account-aware. Config token values win over env fallback. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is only used for the default account.
</Note>

## Runtime model

- Gateway owns the Discord connection.
- Reply routing is deterministic: Discord inbound replies back to Discord.
- By default (`session.dmScope=main`), direct chats share the agent main session (`agent:main:main`).
- Guild channels are isolated session keys (`agent:<agentId>:discord:channel:<channelId>`).
- Group DMs are ignored by default (`channels.discord.dm.groupEnabled=false`).
- Native slash commands run in isolated command sessions (`agent:<agentId>:discord:slash:<userId>`), while still carrying `CommandTargetSessionKey` to the routed conversation session.

## Access control and routing

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DM policy">
    `channels.discord.dmPolicy` controls DM access (legacy: `channels.discord.dm.policy`):

    - `pairing` (default)
    - `allowlist`
    - `open` (requires `channels.discord.allowFrom` to include `"*"`; legacy: `channels.discord.dm.allowFrom`)
    - `disabled`

    If DM policy is not open, unknown users are blocked (or prompted for pairing in `pairing` mode).
>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))

    DM target format for delivery:

    - `user:<id>`
    - `<@id>` mention

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 4) Get the ids (guild/user/channel)
Discord uses numeric ids everywhere; Moltbot config prefers ids.
=======
    Bare numeric IDs are ambiguous and rejected unless an explicit user/channel target kind is provided.

  </Tab>
>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))

  <Tab title="Guild policy">
    Guild handling is controlled by `channels.discord.groupPolicy`:

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 5) Configure Moltbot

#### Token
Set the bot token via env var (recommended on servers):
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...`
=======
    - `open`
    - `allowlist`
    - `disabled`

    Secure baseline when `channels.discord` exists is `allowlist`.

    `allowlist` behavior:

    - guild must match `channels.discord.guilds` (`id` preferred, slug accepted)
    - if a guild has `channels` configured, non-listed channels are denied
    - if a guild has no `channels` block, all channels in that allowlisted guild are allowed
>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))

    Example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
<<<<<<< HEAD
      enabled: true,
      token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    }
  }
}
```

Multi-account support: use `channels.discord.accounts` with per-account tokens and optional `name`. See [`gateway/configuration`](/gateway/configuration#telegramaccounts--discordaccounts--slackaccounts--signalaccounts--imessageaccounts) for the shared pattern.

#### Allowlist + channel routing
Example “single server, only allow me, only allow #help”:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      enabled: true,
      dm: { enabled: false },
      guilds: {
        "YOUR_GUILD_ID": {
          users: ["YOUR_USER_ID"],
=======
      groupPolicy: "allowlist",
      guilds: {
        "123456789012345678": {
>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))
          requireMention: true,
          users: ["987654321098765432"],
          channels: {
<<<<<<< HEAD
            help: { allow: true, requireMention: true }
          }
        }
      },
      retry: {
        attempts: 3,
        minDelayMs: 500,
        maxDelayMs: 30000,
        jitter: 0.1
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `requireMention: true` means the bot only replies when mentioned (recommended for shared channels).
- `agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns` (or `messages.groupChat.mentionPatterns`) also count as mentions for guild messages.
- Multi-agent override: set per-agent patterns on `agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns`.
- If `channels` is present, any channel not listed is denied by default.
- Use a `"*"` channel entry to apply defaults across all channels; explicit channel entries override the wildcard.
- Threads inherit parent channel config (allowlist, `requireMention`, skills, prompts, etc.) unless you add the thread channel id explicitly.
- Bot-authored messages are ignored by default; set `channels.discord.allowBots=true` to allow them (own messages remain filtered).
- Warning: If you allow replies to other bots (`channels.discord.allowBots=true`), prevent bot-to-bot reply loops with `requireMention`, `channels.discord.guilds.*.channels.<id>.users` allowlists, and/or clear guardrails in `AGENTS.md` and `SOUL.md`.

### 6) Verify it works
1. Start the gateway.
2. In your server channel, send: `@Krill hello` (or whatever your bot name is).
3. If nothing happens: check **Troubleshooting** below.

### Troubleshooting
- First: run `moltbot doctor` and `moltbot channels status --probe` (actionable warnings + quick audits).
- **“Used disallowed intents”**: enable **Message Content Intent** (and likely **Server Members Intent**) in the Developer Portal, then restart the gateway.
- **Bot connects but never replies in a guild channel**:
  - Missing **Message Content Intent**, or
  - The bot lacks channel permissions (View/Send/Read History), or
  - Your config requires mentions and you didn’t mention it, or
  - Your guild/channel allowlist denies the channel/user.
- **`requireMention: false` but still no replies**:
- `channels.discord.groupPolicy` defaults to **allowlist**; set it to `"open"` or add a guild entry under `channels.discord.guilds` (optionally list channels under `channels.discord.guilds.<id>.channels` to restrict).
  - If you only set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and never create a `channels.discord` section, the runtime
    defaults `groupPolicy` to `open`. Add `channels.discord.groupPolicy`,
    `channels.defaults.groupPolicy`, or a guild/channel allowlist to lock it down.
- `requireMention` must live under `channels.discord.guilds` (or a specific channel). `channels.discord.requireMention` at the top level is ignored.
- **Permission audits** (`channels status --probe`) only check numeric channel IDs. If you use slugs/names as `channels.discord.guilds.*.channels` keys, the audit can’t verify permissions.
- **DMs don’t work**: `channels.discord.dm.enabled=false`, `channels.discord.dm.policy="disabled"`, or you haven’t been approved yet (`channels.discord.dm.policy="pairing"`).
- **Exec approvals in Discord**: Discord supports a **button UI** for exec approvals in DMs (Allow once / Always allow / Deny). `/approve <id> ...` is only for forwarded approvals and won’t resolve Discord’s button prompts. If you see `❌ Failed to submit approval: Error: unknown approval id` or the UI never shows up, check:
  - `channels.discord.execApprovals.enabled: true` in your config.
  - Your Discord user ID is listed in `channels.discord.execApprovals.approvers` (the UI is only sent to approvers).
  - Use the buttons in the DM prompt (**Allow once**, **Always allow**, **Deny**).
  - See [Exec approvals](/tools/exec-approvals) and [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands) for the broader approvals and command flow.

## Capabilities & limits
- DMs and guild text channels (threads are treated as separate channels; voice not supported).
- Typing indicators sent best-effort; message chunking uses `channels.discord.textChunkLimit` (default 2000) and splits tall replies by line count (`channels.discord.maxLinesPerMessage`, default 17).
- Optional newline chunking: set `channels.discord.chunkMode="newline"` to split on blank lines (paragraph boundaries) before length chunking.
- File uploads supported up to the configured `channels.discord.mediaMaxMb` (default 8 MB).
- Mention-gated guild replies by default to avoid noisy bots.
- Reply context is injected when a message references another message (quoted content + ids).
- Native reply threading is **off by default**; enable with `channels.discord.replyToMode` and reply tags.

## Retry policy
Outbound Discord API calls retry on rate limits (429) using Discord `retry_after` when available, with exponential backoff and jitter. Configure via `channels.discord.retry`. See [Retry policy](/concepts/retry).
=======
            general: { allow: true },
            help: { allow: true, requireMention: true },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

    If you only set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and do not create a `channels.discord` block, runtime fallback is `groupPolicy="open"` (with a warning in logs).

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mentions and group DMs">
    Guild messages are mention-gated by default.

    Mention detection includes:

    - explicit bot mention
    - configured mention patterns (`agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns`, fallback `messages.groupChat.mentionPatterns`)
    - implicit reply-to-bot behavior in supported cases

    `requireMention` is configured per guild/channel (`channels.discord.guilds...`).

    Group DMs:

    - default: ignored (`dm.groupEnabled=false`)
    - optional allowlist via `dm.groupChannels` (channel IDs or slugs)

## Developer Portal setup
>>>>>>> 6bee63864 (docs(channels): modernize discord docs page (#14190))

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create app and bot">

    1. Discord Developer Portal -> **Applications** -> **New Application**
    2. **Bot** -> **Add Bot**
    3. Copy bot token

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Privileged intents">
    In **Bot -> Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:

    - Message Content Intent
    - Server Members Intent (recommended)

    Presence intent is optional and only required if you want to receive presence updates. Setting bot presence (`setPresence`) does not require enabling presence updates for members.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OAuth scopes and baseline permissions">
    OAuth URL generator:

    - scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`

    Typical baseline permissions:

    - View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - Read Message History
    - Embed Links
    - Attach Files
    - Add Reactions (optional)

    Avoid `Administrator` unless explicitly needed.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Copy IDs">
    Enable Discord Developer Mode, then copy:

    - server ID
    - channel ID
    - user ID

    Prefer numeric IDs in OpenClaw config for reliable audits and probes.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Native commands and command auth

- `commands.native` defaults to `"auto"` and is enabled for Discord.
- Per-channel override: `channels.discord.commands.native`.
- `commands.native=false` explicitly clears previously registered Discord native commands.
- Native command auth uses the same Discord allowlists/policies as normal message handling.
- Commands may still be visible in Discord UI for users who are not authorized; execution still enforces OpenClaw auth and returns "not authorized".

See [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands) for command catalog and behavior.

## Feature details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Reply tags and native replies">
    Discord supports reply tags in agent output:

    - `[[reply_to_current]]`
    - `[[reply_to:<id>]]`

    Controlled by `channels.discord.replyToMode`:

    - `off` (default)
    - `first`
    - `all`

    Message IDs are surfaced in context/history so agents can target specific messages.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="History, context, and thread behavior">
    Guild history context:

    - `channels.discord.historyLimit` default `20`
    - fallback: `messages.groupChat.historyLimit`
    - `0` disables

    DM history controls:

    - `channels.discord.dmHistoryLimit`
    - `channels.discord.dms["<user_id>"].historyLimit`

    Thread behavior:

    - Discord threads are routed as channel sessions
    - parent thread metadata can be used for parent-session linkage
    - thread config inherits parent channel config unless a thread-specific entry exists

    Channel topics are injected as **untrusted** context (not as system prompt).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reaction notifications">
    Per-guild reaction notification mode:

    - `off`
    - `own` (default)
    - `all`
    - `allowlist` (uses `guilds.<id>.users`)

    Reaction events are turned into system events and attached to the routed Discord session.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Config writes">
    Channel-initiated config writes are enabled by default.

    This affects `/config set|unset` flows (when command features are enabled).

- `replyToMode`: `off` (default), `first`, or `all`. Applies only when the model includes a reply tag.

## Reply tags
To request a threaded reply, the model can include one tag in its output:
- `[[reply_to_current]]` — reply to the triggering Discord message.
- `[[reply_to:<id>]]` — reply to a specific message id from context/history.
Current message ids are appended to prompts as `[message_id: …]`; history entries already include ids.

Behavior is controlled by `channels.discord.replyToMode`:
- `off`: ignore tags.
- `first`: only the first outbound chunk/attachment is a reply.
- `all`: every outbound chunk/attachment is a reply.

Allowlist matching notes:
- `allowFrom`/`users`/`groupChannels` accept ids, names, tags, or mentions like `<@id>`.
- Prefixes like `discord:`/`user:` (users) and `channel:` (group DMs) are supported.
- Use `*` to allow any sender/channel.
- When `guilds.<id>.channels` is present, channels not listed are denied by default.
- When `guilds.<id>.channels` is omitted, all channels in the allowlisted guild are allowed.
- To allow **no channels**, set `channels.discord.groupPolicy: "disabled"` (or keep an empty allowlist).
- The configure wizard accepts `Guild/Channel` names (public + private) and resolves them to IDs when possible.
- On startup, Moltbot resolves channel/user names in allowlists to IDs (when the bot can search members)
  and logs the mapping; unresolved entries are kept as typed.

Native command notes:
- The registered commands mirror Moltbot’s chat commands.
- Native commands honor the same allowlists as DMs/guild messages (`channels.discord.dm.allowFrom`, `channels.discord.guilds`, per-channel rules).
- Slash commands may still be visible in Discord UI to users who aren’t allowlisted; Moltbot enforces allowlists on execution and replies “not authorized”.

## Tool actions
The agent can call `discord` with actions like:
- `react` / `reactions` (add or list reactions)
- `sticker`, `poll`, `permissions`
- `readMessages`, `sendMessage`, `editMessage`, `deleteMessage`
- Read/search/pin tool payloads include normalized `timestampMs` (UTC epoch ms) and `timestampUtc` alongside raw Discord `timestamp`.
- `threadCreate`, `threadList`, `threadReply`
- `pinMessage`, `unpinMessage`, `listPins`
- `searchMessages`, `memberInfo`, `roleInfo`, `roleAdd`, `roleRemove`, `emojiList`
- `channelInfo`, `channelList`, `voiceStatus`, `eventList`, `eventCreate`
- `timeout`, `kick`, `ban`
=======
  <Accordion title="PluralKit support">
    Enable PluralKit resolution to map proxied messages to system member identity:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      pluralkit: {
        enabled: true,
        token: "pk_live_...", // optional; needed for private systems
      },
    },
  },
}
```

    Notes:

    - allowlists can use `pk:<memberId>`
    - member display names are matched by name/slug
    - lookups use original message ID and are time-window constrained
    - if lookup fails, proxied messages are treated as bot messages and dropped unless `allowBots=true`

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Presence configuration">
    Presence updates are applied only when you set a status or activity field.

    Status only example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      status: "idle",
    },
  },
}
```

    Activity example (custom status is the default activity type):

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      activity: "Focus time",
      activityType: 4,
    },
  },
}
```

    Streaming example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      activity: "Live coding",
      activityType: 1,
      activityUrl: "https://twitch.tv/openclaw",
    },
  },
}
```

    Activity type map:

    - 0: Playing
    - 1: Streaming (requires `activityUrl`)
    - 2: Listening
    - 3: Watching
    - 4: Custom (uses the activity text as the status state; emoji is optional)
    - 5: Competing

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Exec approvals in Discord">
    Discord supports button-based exec approvals in DMs.

    Config path:

    - `channels.discord.execApprovals.enabled`
    - `channels.discord.execApprovals.approvers`
    - `agentFilter`, `sessionFilter`, `cleanupAfterResolve`

    If approvals fail with unknown approval IDs, verify approver list and feature enablement.

## Tools and action gates

Discord message actions include messaging, channel admin, moderation, presence, and metadata actions.

Core examples:

- messaging: `sendMessage`, `readMessages`, `editMessage`, `deleteMessage`, `threadReply`
- reactions: `react`, `reactions`, `emojiList`
- moderation: `timeout`, `kick`, `ban`
- presence: `setPresence`

Action gates live under `channels.discord.actions.*`.

Default gate behavior:

| Action group                                                                                                                                                             | Default  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| reactions, messages, threads, pins, polls, search, memberInfo, roleInfo, channelInfo, channels, voiceStatus, events, stickers, emojiUploads, stickerUploads, permissions | enabled  |
| roles                                                                                                                                                                    | disabled |
| moderation                                                                                                                                                               | disabled |
| presence                                                                                                                                                                 | disabled |

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Used disallowed intents or bot sees no guild messages">

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Safety & ops
- Treat the bot token like a password; prefer the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` env var on supervised hosts or lock down the config file permissions.
- Only grant the bot permissions it needs (typically Read/Send Messages).
- If the bot is stuck or rate limited, restart the gateway (`moltbot gateway --force`) after confirming no other processes own the Discord session.
=======
    - enable Message Content Intent
    - enable Server Members Intent when you depend on user/member resolution
    - restart gateway after changing intents

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Guild messages blocked unexpectedly">

    - verify `groupPolicy`
    - verify guild allowlist under `channels.discord.guilds`
    - if guild `channels` map exists, only listed channels are allowed
    - verify `requireMention` behavior and mention patterns

    Useful checks:

```bash
openclaw doctor
openclaw channels status --probe
openclaw logs --follow
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Require mention false but still blocked">
    Common causes:

    - `groupPolicy="allowlist"` without matching guild/channel allowlist
    - `requireMention` configured in the wrong place (must be under `channels.discord.guilds` or channel entry)
    - sender blocked by guild/channel `users` allowlist

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permissions audit mismatches">
    `channels status --probe` permission checks only work for numeric channel IDs.

    If you use slug keys, runtime matching can still work, but probe cannot fully verify permissions.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DM and pairing issues">

    - DM disabled: `channels.discord.dm.enabled=false`
    - DM policy disabled: `channels.discord.dmPolicy="disabled"` (legacy: `channels.discord.dm.policy`)
    - awaiting pairing approval in `pairing` mode

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bot to bot loops">
    By default bot-authored messages are ignored.

    If you set `channels.discord.allowBots=true`, use strict mention and allowlist rules to avoid loop behavior.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration reference pointers

Primary reference:

- [Configuration reference - Discord](/gateway/configuration-reference#discord)

High-signal Discord fields:

- startup/auth: `enabled`, `token`, `accounts.*`, `allowBots`
- policy: `groupPolicy`, `dm.*`, `guilds.*`, `guilds.*.channels.*`
- command: `commands.native`, `commands.useAccessGroups`, `configWrites`
- reply/history: `replyToMode`, `historyLimit`, `dmHistoryLimit`, `dms.*.historyLimit`
- delivery: `textChunkLimit`, `chunkMode`, `maxLinesPerMessage`
- media/retry: `mediaMaxMb`, `retry`
- actions: `actions.*`
- presence: `activity`, `status`, `activityType`, `activityUrl`
- features: `pluralkit`, `execApprovals`, `intents`, `agentComponents`, `heartbeat`, `responsePrefix`

## Safety and operations

- Treat bot tokens as secrets (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` preferred in supervised environments).
- Grant least-privilege Discord permissions.
- If command deploy/state is stale, restart gateway and re-check with `openclaw channels status --probe`.
